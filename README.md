# As an IT Student at EVSU, I have heard, known, and tried Github. We have onhand experience on it but it really wasn't this deep. We have only tried it just for a specific requirement for an output and did not explore any of this after, well at least for me. But after the discussion, I have learned that Github is more than just a storage or a website to store, keep, or save your Programmming Projects, it can also share, track the history or more specifically the changes you've made with your program, and the most intriguing part is you can collab with other programmers within Github itself. With this, not just the professionals but also students could have an idea or at least gather some in regards with creating new projects or just integrating/upgrading existing projects. From now on, now that I have deeper understanding on what GIthub really is, this is for sure one of the IT Programmers/Professionals best friend.
